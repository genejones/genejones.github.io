	<h1>Dynamic Static Sites with JS</h1>
	<section>
		<p>OK, so static sites have disadvantages.</p>
		<p>Specifically, my site design is even sparser than the standard static site - usually they use something like Jekyll to generate the site, from a dynamic number of blog posts, etc.
		The generator turns all this dynamicism into static HTML. That's very powerful. I didn't go this route for <a href="/blog/2016/why-a-static-site.html">reasons dicussed elsewhere</a>.</p>

		<p>This leftme with a problem: was I really going to update the HTML for my Archives page everytime I added a post in two locations? And also update the homepage under "recent articles"?</p>
		<p>Thankfully, I had experience with templating from Django and, more recently, HandlebarsJS. Templates are, if done properly, elegantly beautiful. They seperate the display logic from the model logic, and elegantly.</p>
		<p>By using HandlebarsJS, the <i>client</i> creates the dynamically generated assets. That frees the burden from my server doing it on the fly (e.g. CGI) or doing this ahead of time (static generator).</p>
		<p>Now I could update a single location (JSON) and changes would flow out to the rest of my site.

		<p>The same advantage a dynamic site, or even a dynamically generated static site, would have is now mine. In this sense, I call this a dynamic static site. It is completly static from a file perspective.
		It also has no generators. But, some presentation logic is dynamically generated on the user's computer as needed.</p>
		<p>It works for a site with small traffic, created by one man. On a large traffic site this would be unfair to the users - the sum of user compute time to generate the dynamic content would far exceed the time for a server to generate the dynamic content and then cache it.
		$$\sum_{n=1}^{100,000} 5 > 1 * CacheOperation * \sum_{n=1}^{100,000} CacheRetrieval $$
