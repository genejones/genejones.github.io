			<h2>How China Rules Consumer Goods</h2>

<p>Made in the USA.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny statement, mostly because of how few consumer goods are <em>made in the USA</em>.</p>

<p>As a child born in the 90&rsquo;s, I can only remember a few products with that origin label. My toys started out as &lsquo;Made in Mexico&rsquo;, some of my electronics said &lsquo;Made in Japan&rsquo;; pretty much everything else had the ubiquitous &lsquo;Made in China&rsquo;.</p>

<p>How did nearly all consumer oriented manufacture shift from the US?</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Cheap Labor</h3>

<p>Labor was comparatively expensive here in the US of A. Very, very comparatively expensive.</p>

<p>Without even getting into unions, minimum hourly wage alone makes labor sourcing non-competitive.</p>

<p>Consumer goods are labor intensive. We forget that, we think that robots can do everything, and do it for cheaper than humans.</p>

<p>Now of course, it&rsquo;s impossible to come back.</p>

<h3>Locus of Innovation</h3>

<p>It used to be you made your goods in China because it was cheaper to build them there.</p>

<p>Now, you build in China because it logistically doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to build elsewhere. All parts can be sourced within 30 miles of each other; only exiting that 30 mile block on a shipping container bound for the Western coastline. This tight of an integration is difficult in the US and elsewhere; we simply don&rsquo;t have that central manufacturing zone.</p>

<p>Beyond this, Shenzen has critical mass, a teeming marketplace of innovation. As an electronics hobbyist, 60% of the datasheets I come across have Mandarin on them. The chemical processes, the warehouses, the materials, the practical know-how &mdash; and more &mdash; is there.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know all the tricks anymore. China out innovates us when it comes to making cheap goods. They make a <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2013/04/22/the-12-cellphone/">$12 cellphone</a> without subsidy or expected carrier return. Sure, the industrial design isn&rsquo;t the best, but that will come with maturity.</p>

<h3>Regulatory Barriers</h3>

<p>If you want to build your next electronic wizmo in the US, go right ahead! Nobody will stop you.</p>

<p>You will, however need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build a factory (which complies to OSHA &amp; EPA standards)</li>
<li>Source <strong>all</strong> your parts from the US, or risk weeks of delays</li>
<li>Find people willing to work at your factory

<ul>
<li>who are skilled at manufacture</li>
<li>who want $20/hour</li>
<li>who aren&rsquo;t going to unionize</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deal with lawsuits of all kinds, warranted and unwarranted</li>
</ul>


<p>Not all of the above are bad things. I certainly want to make more than $20 an hour (and in fact, I do), and I like knowing my office lacks amenities like asbestos. But they sure make it hard to compete with China on consumer goods outside of niche areas.</p>

<p>There are many risks to outsourcing, but never forget that it&rsquo;s very risky to do business in the US too. It&rsquo;s a familiar risk, a risk we are acclimated to, and thus a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation">risk we should be all the more fearful of</a>.</p>
