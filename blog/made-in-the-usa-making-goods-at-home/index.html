			<h2>Why Build Domestic?</h2>

<p>Despite my <a href="http://www.genejon.es/blog/international-business/china-rules-consumer-goods/">previous post</a> it still
makes sense to make consumer goods in the US.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: I am talking real, physical goods here, not software or services.</p>

<h4><strong>Sometimes</strong></h4>

<p>When does it make sense?</p>

<h5>When it&rsquo;s patriotic</h5>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Most business-people are patriotic until it starts impacting their wallet'>
Well, first of the bat, if you are so patriotic, so jingoistic, that the very idea of making your product elsewhere offends you.
Most business-people are patriotic until it starts impacting their wallet. If done correctly, domestic making can increase brand equity, and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t hurt marketing efforts. But this, alone, is almost never sufficient to not outsource.
</span></p>

<h5>When your product needs absolute security.</h5>

<p>National security is a big issue here.
With as much of the US economy being part of the military industrial complex, it can be illegal to source parts from China.</p>

<p>When you can&rsquo;t risk the slightest possible leak, make everyone sign an NDA, threaten to ruin their life if they leak, and then pay well.<br/>
OK, but how many non-military contractor products are truly revolutionary enough to warrant tight security?<br/>
Sure, Apple loves to keep everyone in the dark until the last possible second (as part of their bizare, yet successful marketing strategy).
Who else? No-one? Security is not, outside of national security or unusual circumstances, a major consideration.</p>

<h5>Safety and Quality</h5>

<p>For obvious reasons, foodstuffs are made in the US or Canada. Food spoils, and few want to trust Chinese manufacture with their mouths after various scams.</p>

<p>Highly precise manufacturing also tends to remain in the US or Germany for similiar reasons.</p>

<h5>Small Business</h5>

<p>International Business is hard work. It takes experience, it takes technology, and it takes an open mind. It requires capital, mistakes, and tears.</p>

<p>A small business often can&rsquo;t afford to internationalize. The economies of scale aren&rsquo;t there, inventory headaches can be fatal, and it distracts form their core competencies.</p>

<p>Some startups are designed to scale globally from the ground up. Bully for them, but Mom &amp; Pop stores will continue for a long time.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a>; nearly all of those projects, if funded, will be built in someone&rsquo;s garage. The funded individuals will have a hard enough time running a business in their garage, running an international combination of effort will be beyond them.</p>

<h5>Local Goods</h5>

<p>Some goods will never make economic sense to ship across an ocean, regardless of labor costs.</p>

<h5>Customization</h5>

<p>Oh, you wanted 5 of something, rather than 5,000? Yeah, domestic is the way to go.
If you got the design wrong, or they messed it up, it&rsquo;s a ton easier to get changes made.</p>

<p>Customization is hard enough without adding cross-cultural barriers.</p>

<h5>Frequent Iteration</h5>

<p>Similiar to the above, it&rsquo;s impossible to make rapid changes to anything if you have a 20,000 mile supply chain.
Prototypes, rapidly changing fad designs, and 12 hour turnarounds are only possible domestically.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to note that quick changes are an easy place to innovate in hardware, where designs often remain the same for decades.</p>
