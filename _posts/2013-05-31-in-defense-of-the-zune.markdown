### In Defense of the Zune

I've noticed a disturbing trend at conferences and classes.

Inexplicably, the Zune if brought up as some point of ridicule, like it was doomed to failure.

"Did anyone actually own a Zune?" the speaker nearly always heckles.

I am very proud to raise my hand every time.

The Zune was fantastic.

I don't think we fully remember early days, back when iPod had marketshare, but not a total monopoly.

River was there, Creative, Samsung &  Sandisk had offerings, and yes, Microsoft had the Zune.

But the Zune wasn't a failure. It was an amazing success.

#### The Zune was Amazing

From a technical perspective, the Zune *killed* the current iPod line.

WiFi. In 2006.
Do you know how late Wifi came to Apple's music players?  
2007.
That's right, a full year later.

Also, the iPod touch first gen sucked.

Zune had wireless syncing; Apple did not get this feature for at least two more years.

Do you know what else Zune had? FM radio, along with every other MP3 player on the planet not made by Apple. It took Apple 9 years from the iPod's introduction to grudgingly add an FM radio!
9 years! Do you know how easy FM radio is to add? Hobbyists can trivially add FM radio with a [chip like this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11737).


#### The Zune had better Design

Oh, Jonathon Ives can do no wrong?
Guess what design trend is in right now?

What's that? Flat design?

I wonder who first used Flat design in a product...

Oh, that's right. Zune.

Zune -> Metro UI -> Flat Design Trend.

Guess who is rumored to be adopting Flat Design on their newest devices? Apple? Surely not.

#### Failure not Inevitable
Look, the Zune was fantastic. It some places it was merely equal to the iPod, in others it exceeded it.

The music store concept as a whole was better. The *quirky* music sharing methods could have been a killer app, especially among school kids.
I still would love to share music instantly with someone next to me without fumbling for earpods.

As a pure music device, it killed any iPod offering. Sure, it wasn't a mini-tablet, but it wasn't supposed to be (Microsoft again beat Apple to market here though).

To assume the Zune was doomed is stupid. The marketing was fantastic, the user experience unrivaled.

#### Apple Users need to Stop being so Damn Smug

"Oh, *snicker* looks like Microsoft's product line failed."

"Of course it sucks, it runs *Windows*."

You don't get to be smug because you overpaid for some brushed metal with the same innards as every other PC on the planet.

*I* get to be smug, because I hand-selected my own computer parts, hand-assembled them. *I* get to be smug, because I could make my own MP3 player if I had 60 hours free every week for a year.

Linux users get to be smug, because we were designed to be better. At everything.

Apple does great work. But I hate the cargo cult around it. I hate Microsoft's cult too, but not as much. They aren't as annoyingly smug.
