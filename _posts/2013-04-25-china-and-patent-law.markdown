##A Unique Form of Intellectual Property

China is much maligned on <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> by Western firms.

###Western IP is a Failure
Arguably, China has a better IP model than do.
<!--more-->
The whole idea of Western patent protectionism is generally absurd. 
Patents, originally used to protect small inventors from being ripped off by large companies, have been transformed to steal from them.
 Companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Apple have upwards of 30,000 patents apiece, which they use to force cross-licensing agreements with smaller firms. 
 Copyright has been distorted into an eternal monopoly, rather than a limited exemption from the public domain.
 
 Patent trolls attack with impunity, waiting until patents nearly expire and then claiming that basic, incredibly obvious ideas like shopping carts are ground-breaking innovations that require millions in payments. The USPTO is so bad at granting stupidly obvious applications that they are [now asking for crowdsourcing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19672986) of patent invalidation.
 
 Is it any wonder patent law is one of the best paying fields in America?

Steve Jobs wasn't talking about nukes. He was talking about patents.

### A More Excellent Way

In China, they follow the [beerware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware) model. It relies upon a shared community ethos rather than a strict legal system. Will this system last?

Nobody knows. But it's better than [getting sued for using a scanner](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/meet-the-nice-guy-lawyers-who-want-1000-per-worker-for-using-scanners/).
