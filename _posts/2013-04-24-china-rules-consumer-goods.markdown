## How China Rules Consumer Goods

Made in the USA.

It's a funny statement, mostly because of how few consumer goods are *made in the USA*.

As a child born in the 90's, I can only remember a few products with that origin label. My toys started out as 'Made in Mexico', some of my electronics said 'Made in Japan'; pretty much everything else had the ubiquitous 'Made in China'.

How did nearly all consumer oriented manufacture shift from the US?

### Cheap Labor
Labor was comparatively expensive here in the US of A. Very, very comparatively expensive.

Without even getting into unions, minimum hourly wage alone makes labor sourcing non-competitive.

Consumer goods are labor intensive. We forget that, we think that robots can do everything, and do it for cheaper than humans.

Now of course, it's impossible to come back.

### Locus of Innovation

It used to be you made your goods in China because it was cheaper to build them there.

Now, you build in China because it logistically doesn't make any sense to build elsewhere. All parts can be sourced within 30 miles of each other; only exiting that 30 mile block on a shipping container bound for the Western coastline. This tight of an integration is difficult in the US and elsewhere; we simply don't have that central manufacturing zone.

Beyond this, Shenzen has critical mass, a teeming marketplace of innovation. As an electronics hobbyist, 60% of the datasheets I come across have Mandarin on them. The chemical processes, the warehouses, the materials, the practical know-how -- and more -- is there.

We don't know all the tricks anymore. China out innovates us when it comes to making cheap goods. They make a [$12 cellphone](http://blog.makezine.com/2013/04/22/the-12-cellphone/) without subsidy or expected carrier return. Sure, the industrial design isn't the best, but that will come with maturity.

### Regulatory Barriers

If you want to build your next electronic wizmo in the US, go right ahead! Nobody will stop you.

You will, however need to:

+ Build a factory (which complies to OSHA & EPA standards)
+ Source **all** your parts from the US, or risk weeks of delays
+ Find people willing to work at your factory
    + who are skilled at manufacture
    + who want $20/hour
    + who aren't going to unionize
+ Deal with lawsuits of all kinds, warranted and unwarranted

Not all of the above are bad things. I certainly want to make more than $20 an hour (and in fact, I do), and I like knowing my office lacks amenities like asbestos. But they sure make it hard to compete with China on consumer goods outside of niche areas.

There are many risks to outsourcing, but never forget that it's very risky to do business in the US too. It's a familiar risk, a risk we are acclimated to, and thus a [risk we should be all the more fearful of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation).
