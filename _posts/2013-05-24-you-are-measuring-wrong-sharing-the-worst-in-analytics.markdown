We've all seen **terrible**, *horrifically bad* analytics work.

But it keeps on happening.  
Why?


We haven't been sharing these experience, due to an overabundance of Nondisclosure Agreements.

Which is why I've created a new site: [measuringwrong.com](www.measuringwrong.com)
It's for sharing bad mis-steps with analytics in a safe way.

Go look at [dailyWTF](http://thedailywtf.com/) to see how this will work.

For the protection of the guilty, all names (personal or company) will be annoynmized.
