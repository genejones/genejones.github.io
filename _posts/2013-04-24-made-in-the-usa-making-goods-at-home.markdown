## Why Build Domestic?

Despite my [previous post](http://www.genejon.es/blog/international-business/china-rules-consumer-goods/) it still
makes sense to make consumer goods in the US. 

Just to be clear: I am talking real, physical goods here, not software or services.

####**Sometimes**

When does it make sense?

#####When it's patriotic
{% pullquote %}
Well, first of the bat, if you are so patriotic, so jingoistic, that the very idea of making your product elsewhere offends you.
{"Most business-people are patriotic until it starts impacting their wallet"}. If done correctly, domestic making can increase brand equity, and it certainly doesn't hurt marketing efforts. But this, alone, is almost never sufficient to not outsource.

#####When your product needs absolute security.
National security is a big issue here.
With as much of the US economy being part of the military industrial complex, it can be illegal to source parts from China.

When you can't risk the slightest possible leak, make everyone sign an NDA, threaten to ruin their life if they leak, and then pay well.  
OK, but how many non-military contractor products are truly revolutionary enough to warrant tight security?  
Sure, Apple loves to keep everyone in the dark until the last possible second (as part of their bizare, yet successful marketing strategy).
Who else? No-one? Security is not, outside of national security or unusual circumstances, a major consideration. 

#####Safety and Quality
For obvious reasons, foodstuffs are made in the US or Canada. Food spoils, and few want to trust Chinese manufacture with their mouths after various scams.

Highly precise manufacturing also tends to remain in the US or Germany for similiar reasons.

#####Small Business
International Business is hard work. It takes experience, it takes technology, and it takes an open mind. It requires capital, mistakes, and tears. 

A small business often can't afford to internationalize. The economies of scale aren't there, inventory headaches can be fatal, and it distracts form their core competencies.

Some startups are designed to scale globally from the ground up. Bully for them, but Mom & Pop stores will continue for a long time.

Take a look at [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com); nearly all of those projects, if funded, will be built in someone's garage. The funded individuals will have a hard enough time running a business in their garage, running an international combination of effort will be beyond them.

#####Local Goods
Some goods will never make economic sense to ship across an ocean, regardless of labor costs.

#####Customization
Oh, you wanted 5 of something, rather than 5,000? Yeah, domestic is the way to go.
If you got the design wrong, or they messed it up, it's a ton easier to get changes made.

Customization is hard enough without adding cross-cultural barriers. 

#####Frequent Iteration
Similiar to the above, it's impossible to make rapid changes to anything if you have a 20,000 mile supply chain.
Prototypes, rapidly changing fad designs, and 12 hour turnarounds are only possible domestically.

I'd like to note that quick changes are an easy place to innovate in hardware, where designs often remain the same for decades.
